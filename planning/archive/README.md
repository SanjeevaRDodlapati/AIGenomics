### **WHY ARCHIVED:**
These documents represented an **over-engineered approach** using Next.js 14 with complex features that didn't align with the user's request for a "simple, minimalist and working framework first" approach.

### **CURRENT ACTIVE PLANS:**
See the parent directory for the current **REVISED-** documents that use the **Astro-based minimalist-first approach**.
